Foo Bar
=====================

This is someone I've decided to play around with.  I think bootstrap did a good job, and it's good practice to try to recreate it.  Mine is not as elegant, but I'll for sure update it some more when I have more time.  Open to suggestions.

*Haha, and also Foo Bar is a great name for a bar widget*
